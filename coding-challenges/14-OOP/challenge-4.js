// Your tasks:
// 1. Re-create Challenge #3, but this time using ES6 classes: create an 'EVCl' child class of the 'CarCl' class

// 2. Make the 'charge' property private

// 3. Implement the ability to chain the 'accelerate' and 'chargeBattery' methods of this class, and also update the 'brake' method in the 'CarCl' class. Then experiment with chaining!

// Test data:
// ยง Data car 1: 'Rivian' going at 120 km/h, with a charge of 23%

class Car {
	constructor(make, speed) {
		this.make = make;
		this.speed = speed;
	}

	accelerate() {
		this.speed += 10;
		console.log(`'${this.make}' going at ${this.speed} km/h`);
		return this;
	}

	brake() {
		this.speed -= 5;
		console.log(`${this.make} going at ${this.speed} km/h`);
		return this;
	}

	get speedUS() {
		return this.speed / 1.6;
	}

	set speedUS(speed) {
		this.speed = speed * 1.6;
	}
}

class EV extends Car {
	#charge;

	constructor(make, speed, charge) {
		super(make, speed);
		this.#charge = charge;
	}

	chargeBattery(chargeTo) {
		this.#charge = chargeTo;
		return this;
	}

	accelerate() {
		this.speed += 20;
		this.#charge -= 1;
		console.log(
			`${this.make} going at ${this.speed} km/h, with a charge of ${
				this.#charge
			}%`
		);
		return this;
	}
}
